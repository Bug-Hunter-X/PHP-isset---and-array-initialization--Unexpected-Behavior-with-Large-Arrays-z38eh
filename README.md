# PHP isset() and array initialization: Unexpected Behavior with Large Arrays

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially impactful bug in PHP related to how `isset()` interacts with array initialization and increment operations, particularly when dealing with large arrays.

The `bug.php` file contains a function `incrementArrayValue` that intends to increment an element of an array. However, if the index is not present, it uses `isset()` to detect this and initializes the value to 0 before incrementing. While this might seem correct, it can be inefficient and even cause issues with memory usage if dealing with large arrays.

The `bugSolution.php` file provides a more efficient and robust solution, illustrating how to improve performance and avoid potential memory problems when incrementing array elements that might not exist.
